# Cpu Scheduler Algorithm

CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution.

This repository contains the source file and the executable files of the calculator for the simulations of cpu scheduling:

It comes with the ff algorithms: 
 First Come First Serve (FCFS)
 ,Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling
 ,Shortest Remaining Time
 ,Priority Scheduling (Pre-Emptive)
 ,Priority Scheduling (Non Pre-Emptive)
 ,Round Robin Scheduling.

# Executables

CPUScheduler.exe 
CPUScheduler.jar

Use CPUScheduler.exe to execute the file or use the jar file if the exe file failed to execute.
